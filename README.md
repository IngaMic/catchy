# KOTI shopping assistant
</br>
It's an application for those who like to decide on their shopping list together.
</br>
The first registered user shares his randomly generated code for his partners registration. After they team up,
users may add their desired items to a Review list (filling the form manually or searching for items online).

Added item enters the Matches list only after both users say "yes" going through their Review list.
</br>
Users may also add comments when reviewing.
